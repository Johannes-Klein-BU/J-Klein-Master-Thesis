# J-Klein-Master-Thesis

This is the code used in Johannes Klein's master's thesis for the regression analysis, scenario analysis, and sensitivity analysis.

## regression analysis
Conducts a regression analysis using historical data on electricity prices and investments in renewable energy sources (RES) in Germany to evaluate how electricity prices impact RES investments.

## scenario analysis
Simulates 2030 electricity prices in Germany under different bidding zone configurations, using Python to model and forecast prices for a single zone, 2-zone split, and 4-zone split.

## sensitivity analysis
Step 3 involves conducting a sensitivity analysis to evaluate how changes in key input factors affect simulated electricity prices under various bidding zone configurations, using a 10% increase and decrease for each factor.
